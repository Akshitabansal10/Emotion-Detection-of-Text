# Emotion-Detection-of-Text

The objective is to introduce a model capable of conducting sentiment analysis on actual data gathered from Twitter. Because Twitter data
is so unstructured, analysis is challenging. Flair is a simple natural language processing (NLP) library developed and open sourced by Zalando Research. Flairâ€™s framework builds directly on PyTorch, one of the best deep learning frameworks out there.
Using this we understand the sentiment of the tone of comment whether it positive, neutral and negative ie. Hppy , neutral or sad.
